## Configuration {#security-configuration}

Laravel aims to make implementing authentication very simple. In fact, almost everything is configured for you out of the box. The authentication configuration file is located at `app/config/auth.php`, which contains several well documented options for tweaking the behavior of the authentication facilities.

By default, Laravel includes a `User` model in your `app/models` directory which may be used with the default Eloquent authentication driver. Please remember when building the Schema for this Model to ensure that the password field is a minimum of 60 characters.

If your application is not using Eloquent, you may use the `database` authentication driver which uses the Laravel query builder.

## Storing Passwords {#storing-passwords}

The Laravel `Hash` class provides secure Bcrypt hashing:

**Hashing A Password Using Bcrypt**

	$password = Hash::make('secret');

**Verifying A Password Against A Hash**

	if (Hash::check('secret', $hashedPassword))
	{
		// The passwords match...
	}

**Checking If A Password Needs To Be Rehashed**

	if (Hash::needsRehash($hashed))
	{
		$hashed = Hash::make('secret');
	}

## Authenticating Users {#authenticating-users}

To log a user into your application, you may use the `Auth::attempt` method.

	if (Auth::attempt(array('email' => $email, 'password' => $password)))
	{
		return Redirect::intended('dashboard');
	}

Take note that `email` is not a required option, it is merely used for example. You should use whatever column name corresponds to a "username" in your database. The `Redirect::intended` function will redirect the user to the URL they were trying to access before being caught by the authentication filter. A fallback URI may be given to this method in case the intended destination is not available.

When the `attempt` method is called, the `auth.attempt` [event](#events) will be fired. If the authentication attempt is successful and the user is logged in, the `auth.login` event will be fired as well.

To determine if the user is already logged into your application, you may use the `check` method:

**Determining If A User Is Authenticated**

	if (Auth::check())
	{
		// The user is logged in...
	}

If you would like to provide "remember me" functionality in your application, you may pass `true` as the second argument to the `attempt` method, which will keep the user authenticated indefinitely (or until they manually logout):

**Authenticating A User And "Remembering" Them**

	if (Auth::attempt(array('email' => $email, 'password' => $password), true))
	{
		// The user is being remembered...
	}

**Note:** If the `attempt` method returns `true`, the user is considered logged into the application.

You also may add extra conditions to the authenticating query:

**Authenticating A User With Conditions**

    if (Auth::attempt(array('email' => $email,
      'password' => $password, 'active' => 1))
    {
        // The user is active, not suspended, and exists.
    }

Once a user is authenticated, you may access the User model / record:

**Accessing The Logged In User**

	$email = Auth::user()->email;

To simply log a user into the application by their ID, use the `loginUsingId` method:

	Auth::loginUsingId(1);

The `validate` method allows you to validate a user's credentials without actually logging them into the application:

**Validating User Credentials Without Login**

	if (Auth::validate($credentials))
	{
		//
	}

You may also use the `once` method to log a user into the application for a single request. No sessions or cookies will be utilized.

**Logging A User In For A Single Request**

	if (Auth::once($credentials))
	{
		//
	}

**Logging A User Out Of The Application**

	Auth::logout();

## Protecting Routes {#protecting-routes}

Route filters may be used to allow only authenticated users to access a given route. Laravel provides the `auth` filter by default, and it is defined in `app/filters.php`.

**Protecting A Route**

	Route::get('profile', array('before' => 'auth', function()
	{
		// Only authenticated users may enter...
	}));

### CSRF Protection

Laravel provides an easy method of protecting your application from cross-site request forgeries.

**Inserting CSRF Token Into Form**

    <input type="hidden" name="_token" value="<?php echo csrf_token(); ?>">

**Validate The Submitted CSRF Token**

    Route::post('register', array('before' => 'csrf', function()
    {
        return 'You gave a valid CSRF token!';
    }));

## HTTP Basic Authentication {#http-basic-authentication}

HTTP Basic Authentication provides a quick way to authenticate users of your application without setting up a dedicated "login" page. To get started, attach the `auth.basic` filter to your route:

**Protecting A Route With HTTP Basic**

	Route::get('profile', array('before' => 'auth.basic', function()
	{
		// Only authenticated users may enter...
	}));

By default, the `basic` filter will use the `email` column on the user record when authenticating. If you wish to use another column you may pass the column name as the first parameter to the `basic` method:

	return Auth::basic('username');

You may also use HTTP Basic Authentication without setting a user identifier cookie in the session, which is particularly useful for API authentication. To do so, define a filter that returns the `onceBasic` method:

**Setting Up A Stateless HTTP Basic Filter**

	Route::filter('basic.once', function()
	{
		return Auth::onceBasic();
	});

## Password Reminders & Reset {#password-reminders-and-reset}

### Sending Password Reminders

Most web applications provide a way for users to reset their forgotten passwords. Rather than forcing you to re-implement this on each application, Laravel provides convenient methods for sending password reminders and performing password resets. To get started, verify that your `User` model implements the `Illuminate\Auth\Reminders\RemindableInterface` contract. Of course, the `User` model included with the framework already implements this interface.

**Implementing The RemindableInterface**

	class User extends Eloquent implements RemindableInterface {

		public function getReminderEmail()
		{
			return $this->email;
		}

	}

Next, a table must be created to store the password reset tokens. To generate a migration for this table, simply execute the `auth:reminders` Artisan command:

**Generating The Reminder Table Migration**

	php artisan auth:reminders

	php artisan migrate

To send a password reminder, we can use the `Password::remind` method:

**Sending A Password Reminder**

	Route::post('password/remind', function()
	{
		$credentials = array('email' => Input::get('email'));

		return Password::remind($credentials);
	});

Note that the arguments passed to the `remind` method are similar to the `Auth::attempt` method. This method will retrieve the `User` and send them a password reset link via e-mail. The e-mail view will be passed a `token` variable which may be used to construct the link to the password reset form. The `user` object will also be passed to the view.

> **Note:** You may specify which view is used as the e-mail message by changing the `auth.reminder.email` configuration option. Of course, a default view is provided out of the box.

You may modify the message instance that is sent to the user by passing a Closure as the second argument to the `remind` method:

	return Password::remind($credentials, function($message, $user)
	{
		$message->subject('Your Password Reminder');
	});

You may also have noticed that we are returning the results of the `remind` method directly from a route. By default, the `remind` method will return a `Redirect` to the current URI. If an error occurred while attempting to reset the password, an `error` variable will be flashed to the session, as well as a `reason`, which can be used to extract a language line from the `reminders` language file. If the password reset was successful, a `success` variable will be flashed to the session. So, your password reset form view could look something like this:

	@if (Session::has('error'))
		{{ trans(Session::get('reason')) }}
	@elseif (Session::has('success'))
		An e-mail with the password reset has been sent.
	@endif

	<input type="text" name="email">
	<input type="submit" value="Send Reminder">

### Resetting Passwords

Once a user has clicked on the reset link from the reminder e-mail, they should be directed to a form that includes a hidden `token` field, as well as a `password` and `password_confirmation` field. Below is an example route for the password reset form:

	Route::get('password/reset/{token}', function($token)
	{
		return View::make('auth.reset')->with('token', $token);
	});

And, a password reset form might look like this:

	@if (Session::has('error'))
		{{ trans(Session::get('reason')) }}
	@endif

	<input type="hidden" name="token" value="{{ $token }}">
	<input type="text" name="email">
	<input type="password" name="password">
	<input type="password" name="password_confirmation">

Again, notice we are using the `Session` to display any errors that may be detected by the framework while resetting passwords. Next, we can define a `POST` route to handle the reset:

	Route::post('password/reset/{token}', function()
	{
		$credentials = array('email' => Input::get('email'));

		return Password::reset($credentials, function($user, $password)
		{
			$user->password = Hash::make($password);

			$user->save();

			return Redirect::to('home');
		});
	});

If the password reset is successful, the `User` instance and the password will be passed to your Closure, allowing you to actually perform the save operation. Then, you may return a `Redirect` or any other type of response from the Closure which will be returned by the `reset` method. Note that the `reset` method automatically checks for a valid `token` in the request, valid credentials, and matching passwords.

Also, similarly to the `remind` method, if an error occurs while resetting the password, the `reset` method will return a `Redirect` to the current URI with an `error` and `reason`.

## Encryption {#encryption}

Laravel provides facilities for strong AES-256 encryption via the mcrypt PHP extension:

**Encrypting A Value**

	$encrypted = Crypt::encrypt('secret');

> **Note:** Be sure to set a 32 character, random string in the `key` option of the `app/config/app.php` file. Otherwise, encrypted values will not be secure.

**Decrypting A Value**

	$decrypted = Crypt::decrypt($encryptedValue);

You may also set the cipher and mode used by the encrypter:

**Setting The Cipher & Mode**

	Crypt::setMode('ctr');

	Crypt::setCipher($cipher);

## Usage

To view a list of all available Artisan commands, you may use the `list` command:

	php artisan list

Every command also includes a "help" screen which displays and describes the command's available arguments and options. To view a help screen, simply precede the name of the command with `help`:

	php artisan migrate --env=local

You may also view the current version of your Laravel installation using the `--version` option:
